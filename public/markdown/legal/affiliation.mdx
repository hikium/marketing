# Project Affiliation Notice

The Hikium Project is formed by people which Members declare as affiliated to the project. Someone affiliated to the project is known as a Team Member and those affiliated to the project are collectively known as Team Members. The employers, contractors, and academic institutions that a Team Member may be affiliated with are collectively as Additional Parties.

Each Team Member agrees to the Project Affiliation Agreement. Team Members are proud to share the Team Member Commitments outlined in the Agreement:

Team Members:

- acknowledge Additional Parties,
- do not represent Additional Parties when working on or representing the Project,
- and do not, to a reasonable extent, represent Additional Parties when editing, exhibiting, or actively possessing intellectual property related to the Project licensed to a Member, Recognised Collaborator, or Affiliated Individual by a Member.

Additional Parties are encouraged to contact the Hikium team should an incident involving a Team Member arise.
