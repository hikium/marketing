# Responsibly Disclosing Security Vulnerabilities

The Hikium team is committed to security. It's very important.

If you have found a legitimate security vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report the vulnerability to our team.

## Step 1: Get the version string

First, note the version string, if you can find it. A version string, like "Version 1.0.0", is quite helpful.

## Step 2: Report the vulnerability

Next, report the vulnerability to us.

Email us. Currently this is at hikium-team@outlook.com.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Thank you for helping make Hikium products, projects, and services more secure.
