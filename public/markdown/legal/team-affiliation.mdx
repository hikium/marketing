# Project Affiliation Notice

There is a relationship between Hikium team members and recognised collaborators (each a “Member,” “Recognised Collaborator,” or "Affiliated Individual,” collectively, “Team Members”) and the employers, contractors, and academic institutions they may be affiliated with (collectively, “Additional Parties”).

Team Members:

- acknowledge Additional Parties,
- do not represent Additional Parties when working on or representing Hikium projects and initiatives,
- and do not, to a reasonable extent, represent Additional Parties when editing, exhibiting, or actively possessing intellectual property related to the Hikium project licensed to a Member, Recognised Collaborator, or Affiliated Individual by a Member.

Additional Parties are encouraged to contact the Hikium team should an incident involving a Member or Recognised Collaborator arise.

Information about Members, Recognised Collaborators, and Protected Individuals can be requested.

Individuals who contribute to Hikium open-source software projects that are not declared as a Member, Recognised Collaborator, or Affiliated Individual are not considered a Member, Recognised Collaborator, or Affiliated Individual.
