# Hikium Privacy Statement

Thank you for building your websites with Hikium Experience Composer and trusting us with your projects and your personal data.

Together with other entities (collectively, “Third-Parties”, each a “Third-Party”), the Hikium project (”Hikium,” “we”) is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Statement outlines how we collect and use personal and technical data across Hikium Experience Composer and the Hikium marketing websites (collectively, the “Service”), effective from November 28, 2022.

## Data Controller

Anyone declared by Hikium as affiliated to the project can collect and use personal and technical data, but the data controller is always Noah Stanley.

## Data We Automatically Collect

### Aggregated Activity Data

Each time you use the Service, we automatically collect data about how you use the Service. This may include:

- the webpages you visit,
- the features you use,
- the date and time,
- how long you use the Service,
- the referring website or application,
- the language of the web browser or application supporting software (which may be inherited from the operating system),
- information about the colour capabilities of the screen of the device,
- the name of the device (for example, “iPhone 14”),
- the name of the manufacturer of the device (for example, “Apple”),
- the name and version of the operating system (for example, “Windows 11”),
- the name and version of the web browser or application supporting software (for example, “Chrome 105”),
- and the size of the window of the web browser or standalone application window.

Aggregated Activity Data is always comprehensively anonymised and not personal data. It cannot be used to personally identify you. Additionally, Aggregated Activity Data must be anonymised before the transmission to Hikium is completed.

### Technical Data

Each time you use the Service, the Service may automatically collect data that is technical in nature. This may include:

- the name and version of the operating system (for example, “Windows 11”),
- the name and version of the web browser or application supporting software (for example, “Chrome 105”),
- operating system accessibility settings,
- operating system colour and theming settings,
- operating system network settings,
- the size of the window of the web browser or standalone application window,
- information about the cache size,
- and approximated information about how much storage is available on the device.

## Persistent Data

### Web Storage Technologies

The Service uses web storage technologies (”Web Storage”) to persist data between sessions. Web Storage is specific to each device, and each web browser or application supporting software on that device.

Hikium Experience Composer uses Web Storage to store data that describes your website and to store application settings data. Hikium marketing websites do not use Web Storage.

Your consent to data collection in the Data You Consent to Collection section is maintained through Web Storage.

### No Cookies

The Service does not use first-party or third-party cookies.

## Lawful Basis for Data Collection

Some jurisdictions require Hikium to declare a lawful basis for the collection of personal data.

### Aggregated Activity Data and Technical Data

The collection of Aggregated Activity Data and Technical Data is lawful because:

- it is necessary for the performance of a contract, for example, the Hikium Experience Composer Terms of Usage,
- and it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Hikium.

## Sharing of Data

### Sharing of Data with Service Providers

We may share technical data with Third-Parties that provide the Service (collectively, “Service Providers”). The sharing of technical data with Service Providers is necessary to ensure the Service can be provided across the world to satisfactory performance and security standards. Service Providers also includes the providers of Service Providers.

### Sharing of Data for Legal Reasons

Hikium may share the data we have collected if required by law, or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or to protect Hikium's rights or intellectual property, or in the event of a court order or subpoena affecting Hikium or anyone declared by Hikium as affiliated to the project.

### Change in Control

We may share personal and technical data to a Third-Party if that Third-Party is engaged in the merger or acquisition of the Service. If a merger or acquisition of the Service is successful, the Third-Party merging with or acquiring the Service becomes the data controller effective immediately.

### No Sale of Data

We do not sell your personal data for monetary or other consideration as defined under California and Nevada state laws, or laws of similar effect in force in other jurisdictions.

### Information Received by a Third-Party

If we receive personal information about you from a Third-Party, we will protect it as set out in this Privacy Statement.

## Retention of Data

### Aggregated Activity Data

Aggregated Activity Data is retained for as long as Hikium has a legitimate interest in the data.

### Technical Data

Technical Data is per-request only and is naturally discarded following its collection.

## Access to Data

### Portability of Web Storage

As a user of Hikium Experience Composer, you can always access and download your Web Storage. Use Hikium Experience Composer Settings to export your data.

### Access to Personally Identifiable Information

Hikium does not collect information that could identify who you are. As such and overall, there is no method for accessing your personal information that Hikium has collected.

## Do-Not-Track Signals

The Service does not track you across Third-Party websites, applications, and services. Additionally, the Service implements comprehensive consent and privacy protections. Therefore, the Service does not respond to Do-Not-Track signals.

## Changes to the Privacy Statement

Although most changes to the Privacy Statement over time are likely to be minor, Hikium changes the Privacy Statement from time to time.

Some changes, like spelling and grammar corrections, are considered as amendments only. We may not notify you about amendments.

Material changes, including changes to what data we collect, who we share it with, and how long we retain data, significantly alter the effect of the Privacy Statement. These changes alter how Hikium and Third-Parties respects your privacy and data, and Hikium will notify you of material changes up to 30 days before the changes take effect.
